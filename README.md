The Shoppies is a movie award that Shopify gives to Enterpreneurs(not really!). Users can use this website to find and nominate the movies that they like for the award. 

The shoppies uses OMDB API for the movie info, a big shout out to them, and React, @material-ui, notistack for their awesome library too!
